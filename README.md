# Demo-JVM-Bytecode
Code exploring JVM bytecode

## jasm
This is an example showing how to use the "jasm" Java assembler. Note that the Gradle plugin (and the assembler itself, I think) is officially archived, so don't expect anything by way of support for it. That said, the JVM bytecode set hasn't changed much, so it's not like there needs to be much, if you ask me.
